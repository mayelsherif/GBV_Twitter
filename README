This project uses the Twitter Streaming API in order to collect
real-time Tweets generated on reservations AND generated with 
response to critical social media movements.

A cron job collects tweets on the hour and then processes them
with various filtering methods in order to minimize space used 
and to maximize meaning of the data collected.

This file is intended to serve as a map for the collection project.
